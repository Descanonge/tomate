#+TITLE: Data Loader

* TODO: compute linear combinations
* TODO: Save metadata to file
To not need to scan files each time
* TODO: Multiple selections
in a subclass of database ?
* TODO: ensure VI stays global
* TODO: doc
** examples
** scan variables examples
* TODO: Write: add to file
** use existing filegroup information to open some files and add variables
* TODO: Compute min / max value
* TODO: iter coordinate (especially time)
* TODO: no type restrictions on keyring
or maybe a new type of Key, for values
it could even englob KeyVar (that seems complicated)
* TODO: coord attribute scanning is flawed
** From which filegroup do you transfer attributes to master coords ?
* TODO: check error when shared cs has no scanning
* TODO: loading could fail if available is modified
idea for more robustness ?
I guess FG should communicate with available instead of relying on contains
* TODO: Plot return new object
returns object with info about whats plotted
    -> scope, object (image / contours)
    -> method to update ?
then no need for dt.plotted
* TODO: move into data_types
